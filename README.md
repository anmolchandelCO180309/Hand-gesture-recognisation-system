# Hand-gesture-recognisation-system
Hand gesture recognition is a cool project to start for a Computer Vision enthusiast as it involves an intuitive step-by-step procedure which could be easily understood, so that you could build more complex stuff on top of these concepts. This Project is about recognizing number of fingers showing in front of live feed camera. Using Hand Cascade XML (Basically Haar Cascades can be used to detect any types of objects as long as we have the appropriate XML file for it. We can even create our own XML files from scratch to detect whatever type of object we want. For example here we are identifying Palm.
